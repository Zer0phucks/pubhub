## üîí Critical Security Fixes

### 1. JWT Verification (CRITICAL - Fixed ‚úÖ)

**Previous Issue:**
- JWT tokens were decoded without cryptographic signature verification
- Anyone could forge a JWT and bypass authentication
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete authentication bypass vulnerability

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added proper JWT verification module (`jwt.ts`)
- Integrated with Clerk's API for token verification in strict mode
- Environment-based security modes:
  - `SECURITY_MODE=strict`: Full JWT verification with Clerk API (production)
  - `SECURITY_MODE=dev`: Unverified decoding with demo fallback (development only)

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/make-server-dc1f2437/jwt.ts` (NEW)
- `supabase/functions/make-server-dc1f2437/index.ts`

**How to Enable Strict Mode (Production):**
```bash
supabase secrets set SECURITY_MODE=strict --project-ref vcdfzxjlahsajulpxzsn
```

---

### 2. CORS Wildcard Removed (CRITICAL - Fixed ‚úÖ)

**Previous Issue:**
- CORS configured with `origin: '*'` accepting requests from any domain
- Vulnerable to CSRF attacks and unauthorized API access
- **Severity**: Critical - Cross-origin attacks possible

**Fix Implemented:**
- Environment-based allowed origins configuration
- Explicit whitelist of trusted domains
- Default allowed origins:
  - `https://pubhub.dev`
  - `https://www.pubhub.dev`
  - `http://localhost:3000`
  - `http://localhost:5173`

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/make-server-dc1f2437/index.ts`

**How to Configure (Production):**
```bash
supabase secrets set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://pubhub.dev,https://www.pubhub.dev" --project-ref vcdfzxjlahsajulpxzsn
```

---

### 3. Error Boundaries Added (HIGH - Fixed ‚úÖ)

**Previous Issue:**
- React component errors could crash the entire application
- No graceful error handling for component failures
- **Severity**: High - Poor user experience and debugging difficulties

**Fix Implemented:**
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component with graceful error UI
- Wrapped critical app sections in error boundaries
- Development mode error details for debugging
- User-friendly error messages in production

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Security Concerns

### 1. Rate Limiting (HIGH Priority)

**Issue:**
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- Vulnerable to abuse, DDoS, and resource exhaustion
- **Impact**: Service disruption, increased costs, data scraping

**Recommendation:**
- Implement rate limiting middleware in Edge Functions
- Suggested limits:
  - Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/min per IP
  - Reddit scan endpoints: 10 requests/hour per user
  - AI generation endpoints: 50 requests/hour per user
- Use Upstash or similar for distributed rate limiting

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Should be next security task

---

### 2. Input Validation (MEDIUM Priority)

**Issue:**
- Limited input validation on API endpoints
- Potential for injection attacks if user input is not properly sanitized
- **Impact**: Data integrity issues, potential security exploits

**Recommendation:**
- Add Zod or similar validation library
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize all data before storing or displaying

**Example:**
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const projectSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  description: z.string().min(1).max(500),
  url: z.string().url().optional(),
  subreddits: z.array(z.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/)).max(20),
});
```

---

### 3. API Response Validation (MEDIUM Priority)

**Issue:**
- API responses are not validated or sanitized
- Potential for data leakage if backend returns sensitive information
- **Impact**: Information disclosure, debugging information leakage

**Recommendation:**
- Implement response validation schemas
- Strip sensitive fields before sending responses
- Add response sanitization middleware

---

### 4. Environment Variable Exposure (MEDIUM Priority)

**Issue:**
- Some environment variables in `.env.local` are committed to git
- **Impact**: Potential secret exposure if repository becomes public

**Current Mitigation:**
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- Secrets are managed through Supabase secrets for production

**Recommendation:**
- Use environment variable management service (e.g., Doppler, Infisical)
- Rotate all secrets regularly
- Audit secret usage and remove unused keys

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Development vs Production

**Development Mode** (`SECURITY_MODE=dev`):
- JWT decoding without verification (INSECURE)
- Demo user fallback enabled
- Expanded CORS origin acceptance
- Detailed error messages
- **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER use in production**

**Production Mode** (`SECURITY_MODE=strict`):
- Full JWT verification with Clerk API
- No demo user fallback - authentication required
- Strict CORS origin checking
- Generic error messages
- **‚úÖ Always use in production**

---

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] `SECURITY_MODE=strict` is set
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` contains only production domains
- [ ] All secrets are rotated and set via `supabase secrets set`
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented and tested
- [ ] Error boundaries are functioning correctly
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are configured
- [ ] No demo credentials exist in production database

---

### Environment Variables Security

**Backend (Edge Functions):**
```bash
# Critical - Must be set
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
SECURITY_MODE=strict
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://pubhub.dev,https://www.pubhub.dev

# API Keys
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=xxx
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=xxx
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=xxx

# Supabase (auto-configured, don't set manually)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx
```

**Frontend (.env.local):**
```bash
# Public keys (safe to expose)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing

### Manual Testing

**Test JWT Verification:**
```bash
# Test with invalid token (should fail in strict mode)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" \
  https://vcdfzxjlahsajulpxzsn.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-dc1f2437/auth-test

# Expected response (strict mode): 401 Unauthorized
# Expected response (dev mode): Demo user
```

**Test CORS:**
```bash
# Test from unauthorized origin (should fail in strict mode)
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious.com" \
  https://vcdfzxjlahsajulpxzsn.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-dc1f2437/health

# Expected response: CORS headers should NOT include malicious.com
```

### Automated Security Testing

**Run security audit:**
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

---

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging

Current logging includes:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Security mode status
- CORS origin checks
- JWT verification results

**Recommended Additions:**
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual API access patterns
- Error boundary triggers

### Metrics to Track

- Failed authentication attempts per hour
- API endpoint usage patterns
- Error boundary activation frequency
- CORS violations
- Rate limit hits

---

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detect**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity
2. **Contain**: Temporarily block affected endpoints if needed
3. **Investigate**: Analyze logs to understand the attack vector
4. **Remediate**: Apply fixes and rotate compromised credentials
5. **Review**: Update security measures to prevent recurrence
