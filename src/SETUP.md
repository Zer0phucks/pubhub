## Overview
PubHub is a Reddit engagement platform that helps app developers connect with their customers on Reddit using AI-powered responses.

## Authentication

PubHub uses **Clerk** for authentication, providing secure and user-friendly sign-up and sign-in flows with support for email/password, social login, and more.

## Environment Variables Required

You need to configure the following secrets in the Supabase environment:

### 1. Clerk Authentication
- **CLERK_SECRET_KEY**: Your Clerk secret key
  - Get this from your Clerk Dashboard at https://dashboard.clerk.com
  - Navigate to "API Keys" section
  - Copy the "Secret Key" (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
  
**Note:** The Clerk Publishable Key is already embedded in the app. For production use, you would set this as an environment variable.

### 2. Azure OpenAI Configuration
- **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your Azure OpenAI API key
- **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
  - Format: `https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview`
  - Replace `YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME` with your Azure OpenAI resource name
  - Replace `YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` with your GPT-4 deployment name (e.g., "gpt-5-mini")

### 3. Reddit API Configuration âœ… CONFIGURED
Your Reddit API credentials have been set up! The integration is ready to use.

- âœ… Automatic feed item creation for engagement opportunities

**How to create your own Reddit app** (if you need new credentials):
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: PubHub (or your preferred name)
   - **App type**: Select "script"
