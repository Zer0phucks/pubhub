4. Review Clerk Dashboard logs

### If backend APIs fail:
1. Verify Supabase edge function is deployed
2. Check edge function logs: `supabase functions logs server`
3. Verify all secrets are set correctly
4. Test edge function directly

### If build fails:
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Check for TypeScript errors
3. Review Vercel build logs
4. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
