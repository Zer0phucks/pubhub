// Transform video to blog post
const transformToBlogPost = (video: Video): TransformedContent => {
  const transcript = getMockTranscript(video);
  
  const blogContent = `# ${video.title}

*Originally published as a video on ${video.platform === 'youtube' ? 'YouTube' : 'TikTok'} • ${new Date(video.publishedAt).toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' })}*

${transcript.split('\n\n').map((paragraph, index) => {
    if (index === 0) {
      return paragraph;
    }
    if (paragraph.includes(':')) {
      const lines = paragraph.split('\n');
      return lines[0] + '\n\n' + lines.slice(1).map(line => line.trim()).join('\n');

In my latest video, I break down the key strategies that successful creators are using to achieve results. Here's what you need to know:

🎯 Key Insights:

1. Foundation Matters
Understanding the fundamentals is non-negotiable. The creators who succeed are the ones who master the basics before moving to advanced strategies.

2. Consistency Over Perfection
Don't wait for everything to be perfect. Start implementing today, learn from feedback, and iterate.

3. Avoid These Common Mistakes
• Trying to do too much at once
• Not tracking metrics and progress
• Giving up too early

4. The Action Plan
Focus on one core strategy, implement it consistently for 30 days, and measure your results. Then optimize and scale.

💡 Pro Tip: The difference between those who succeed and those who don't often comes down to taking action on what they learn.

I dive deeper into all of this in the full video (link in comments).
